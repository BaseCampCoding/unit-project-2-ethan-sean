#Mock Bank System
###Description and Motivation
With the idea of this project we want to create a mock bank system. Giving a user the ability to either create an account or login. The user will be given an account number and then have access to different functions such as withdraw money, deposit money and check balance. This will also include a simple GUI to go along with it. The reason behind this project is to build something that has real world application and could eventually be built into something useful and effective.
###Prior Art
Many iterations of bank account management systems exist everywhere, but how they are built is mostly unknown by the public. We want to create our own just to give a concept idea of how those might be built.
